# Lever Web3 Front-end

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community to help keep the Lever web3 front-end working great. You can read more here about [how to contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Configuration

The web3 front-end requires several items to be configured before it can be started properly. The required format is of the form of several json files that specify config options between local development (`development.json`) and the version that is intended to be deployed (`production.json`). The local and deployment scripts automatically look for those files to exist in the path `config/env`.

## Getting Started

The Lever web3 front-end is written in [elm](http://elm-lang.org/) and was bootstrapped with [create elm app](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app). We strongly recommmend getting familiar with the Elm framework before jumping into the Lever source code.
